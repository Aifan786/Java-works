Q.  Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

Ans => Abstract class:
       
       *Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract keyword.
       *Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
       *Abstract class can be extended using "extend" keyword.
       
       Example:
       
       public abstract class Shape{
       
         public abstract void draw();
         
       }
       
       Inteface:
       
       *Interface can have abstract method. Since Java 8 can have default and 
        static method also.
       *Interface supports multiple inheritance.
       *Interface can be implemented using "implements" keyword.
       
       Example:
       
       public interface shape{
       
          void draw();
          default void color();
       
       }
