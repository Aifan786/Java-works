Q. Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?

Ans => Multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level, the reason
       behind is to prevent ambiguity.
       Consider a scenario where class C extends class A and class B and both 
       class A and C have same method display(). Now the Java compiler cannot 
       decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation 
       multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java
