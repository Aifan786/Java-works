Q. Explain dynamic polymorphism ?

Ans => In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference 
       variable of a super class. The determination of the method to be called 
       is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
       It occurs at runtime so it is also known as Runtime polymorphism.
